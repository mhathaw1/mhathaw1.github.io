                Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Oh, God! I can't *know* that! Jayne Cobb: I could stand to hear a little more. Dr. Simon Tam: [to River] If there's any fighting, drop to the floor or run away. Kaylee Frye: Goin' on a year now I ain't had nothin' twixt my nethers weren't run on batteries! [pause; regarding the rest of the crew] Dr. Simon Tam: It's okay to leave them to die. Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: [RE: What they found on Miranda] This record here's about twelve years old. Parliament buried it and it stayed buried until River here dug it up. This is what they were afraid she knew. And they were right to fear. There's a universe of folk who're gonna know it, too. Someone *has to* speak for these people. [pause] Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Y'all got on this boat for different reasons, but y'all come to the same place. So now I'm asking more of you than I have before. Maybe all. Sure as I know anything, I know this - they will try again. Maybe on another world, maybe on this very ground swept clean. A year from now, ten? They'll swing back to the belief that they can make people... better. And I do not hold to that. So no more runnin'. I aim to misbehave. Shepherd Book: [dying] I killed the ship that killed us. Not very Christian. Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: You did what was right. Shepherd Book: Coming from you that means - almost nothing. [grin] Mr. Universe: There is no news. There is only the truth of the signal. What I see. And, there's the puppet theater the Parliament jesters foist on the somnambulant public.
