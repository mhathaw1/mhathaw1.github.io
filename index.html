                            Commander William Adama: [President Roslin is bedridden, dying of cancer, and coughing profusely] What can I get you? President Laura Roslin: [sarcastically] A new body. Perhaps, one of those young Cylon models from the Resurrection Ship. Commander William Adama: I can't see you as a blonde. President Laura Roslin: You'd be surprised. [laughs] Commander William Adama: [President Roslin is bedridden, dying of cancer, and coughing profusely] What can I get you? President Laura Roslin: [sarcastically] A new body. Perhaps, one of those young Cylon models from the Resurrection Ship. Commander William Adama: I can't see you as a blonde. President Laura Roslin: You'd be surprised. [laughs] Doctor Gaius Baltar: [Baltar has a two-way argument with Roslin and Number Six at the same time] Well, quite frankly, I don't give a flying frak whether you believe me or not, all right? Because I've had it, I am... I'm tired of being pushed and prodded around like I'm some kind of toy. I'm not your plaything! Number Six, President Laura Roslin: [simultaneously, in stereo] Plaything? Doctor Gaius Baltar: I don't work for you and uh, quite frankly, I don't have to sit any more and take this kind of abuse from either of you!... Er, [points at Billy] Doctor Gaius Baltar: *you* either... either in *here*, either in there, wherever it is... Commander William Adama: Starbuck, what do you hear? Lt. Kara 'Starbuck' Thrace: Nothing but the rain. Commander William Adama: Then grab your gun and bring in the cat. Lt. Kara 'Starbuck' Thrace: Boom, boom, boom! Lt. Kara 'Starbuck' Thrace: [after Starbuck has to plan a vital mission] I never wanted this kind of responsibility. Commander William Adama: The Cylons never asked us what we wanted. Welcome to the big leagues.
